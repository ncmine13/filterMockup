    "excerpt": "Aaron Dignan dressed up like a super hero for 180 straight days in the first grade, which marked the beginning of his life as an iconoclast, an observer, a theorist and a performer. Now, as a founding partner of Undercurrent, a digital strategy firm based in New York, he advises global brands and organizations like PepsiCo, Ford and LiveNation on their future in an increasingly technophilic world. In addition to consulting, Aaron is currently working on a book regarding the convergence of games and everyday life. Aaron has brought his ideas to life for McDonald's, Virgin, PepsiCo, Leo Burnett, Columbia College, The University of Colorado and Interesting New York. <br><br>Prior to founding Undercurrent, Aaron was a partner in the brand strategy firm Brandplay, a frontman for the indie rock band Waking Rothko, a sponsored inline skater, a 2nd degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do, an actor, an armchair philosopher and an avid (and incredibly forgiving) movie goer.",

At age nine he became the full-time pianist for a local church, where he continues to play along with his father as part of a five member band. <br><br>His music space includes classical, jazz and pop - some of his favorite artists and composers include Mozart, Bach and Liz Story - but he's always had a tendency to produce a little extra something beyond whatever music is written on the page he's playing from. Now he's turning those extra somethings into his own original compositions. But only after he's done with his homework.",

His Push Button House for European coffee company illy created significant buzz at the 52nd Venice Biennale, and Kalkin &amp; Co. have developed the Quik Build Disaster Relief Swat Team, a team of architects, energy and water experts, agronomists and builders who are available to provide fast, low cost, environmentally sound emergency housing around the world.",
